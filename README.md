# foxie Codename: (Cubs) V 1.0.2
A legacy inspired Cms taking the parts that work from other mainstream cms's and amalgamate them into a modern Node js base.


If you want to develop, please checkout
node_modules/foxie/schema/data-model/initial-data.js
This is the core config (before I move it to db)
You can change all sorts of things in here

Firstly I would like to say that I have been building my website along with this project to understand what a cms really needs to look like and how it should behave, unfortunately that meens that /public was commited, I am not very good with git I need to make a branch for my site and a mainline branch so I dont think you can develop in the site yet, please feel free to clone it and tear it apart, there are tones of things that could be improved apon. 

The main app theme (foxes) is actually my own website so um delete it, i will add a git ignore asap.

This is a very very rough build, and is packaged all wrong so sorry about guys and galls if you can help me fix it, I would be so gratefull!
