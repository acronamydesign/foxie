# foxie Codename: (Cubs) V 1.0.2
A legacy inspired Cms taking the parts that work from other mainstream cms's and amalgamate them into a modern Node js base.


I would say its hard to develop in at the moment to many bugs, so give it a try but I doubt it will work as expected.

This is a very very rough build, and is packaged all wrong so sorry about guys and galls, that being said it is working for me and so if you like a chalenge! You might need to restart node once you start it, there is a little bug in the router at the moment.

Requires Mongo Db latest

!IMPORTANT!
Passwords are NOT hashed yet so do not use in production

The main app theme is actually my own website so um delete it, i will add a git ignore asap.
